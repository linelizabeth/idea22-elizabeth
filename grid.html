        <h3>Behind the Scenes of Yellow was created as a comprehensive guide about the colour yellow. Through in-depth, self-directed research and analysis, technical study and execution, image/graphic collection and creation I was then able to begin visually communicating connotations associated with yellow. This project required me to use an understanding of visual rhetoric and art direction together with considered practices in publication design. I also created an accompanying digital piece that shows the essentials of the colour in an engaged and succinct format.</h3>

        <h3>In Jungian psychology, the shadow-self is an unconscious aspect of the personality in which repressed traits and experiences accumulate. The shadow-self exists just below the surface of our conscious ego, as our very own “evil personality”. Created for the IDEA program’s 2020 “evil” themed poster show, this illustration was inspired by the terrifying possibility of the shadow-self overtaking consciousness.</h3>

        <h3>Crickies is a fictional brand based in Vancouver that produces protein cookies made with cricket flour. Although 80% of the world’s population consider insects as a part of their diet, it is not a common food in North America. Crickies focuses on getting people to incorporate more sustainable proteins into their everyday diet, fulfilling their protein needs as well as cravings for a delicious treat.</h3>
